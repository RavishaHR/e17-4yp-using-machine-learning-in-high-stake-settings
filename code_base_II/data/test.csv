We use music to connect us to the world and to help prepare us for the rest of our lives. The traits of dedication, perseverance, responsibility, and community are taught and reinforced daily in our pursuit of musical excellence.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Our Timpani (or Kettle Drums) have heads that are very old- older than most of our students!  They are worn, have dents and scratches, and they don't sound as good as what the students know they could.  
We need help to replace these costly, but very needed drum heads for our timpani. Most professionals suggest replacing these heads every few years, but this is such a specialized repair that it is typically very costly and most of that is in the cost of the drum heads themselves. The heads we are looking to purchase will give our students a great sound.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","The kids in our music program are wonderful student musicians.

They come from families with hometown values, believing in hard work, modesty, and respect for those around you.  Many people in this community don't lock their houses or cars, because there is very little crime and people look out for one another.  Each year our school does a fundraiser at Christmas time, to raise money for an organization or charity, that directly benefits people from the community. I am always in awe at the generosity of our community, parents, teachers, and students.  Many of our student do jobs like babysit and shovel snow, to earn money themselves, in order to give a donation.

My students are excited to do science experiments and like to share their ideas.  They ask amazing questions and want to know how things work.
I also coach students that participate in our school Science Olympiad program.  These students go above and beyond to enhance their science knowledge.  They love a challenge and often ask me to give them more material.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Models are often used in science to demonstrate a complex concepts and allow scientists to analyze and make predictions.  They can also allow students to represent things that are too large or too small to work with in real life.  Using Legos to create models, would help students express ideas and practice concepts in a fun, interactive way.

Lego is a line of plastic constructions toys that can be assembled and connected in many ways. This makes an ideal situation for students to build models of cells, atoms, earth, and much more.  Because Legos are such a fun and interactive toy for all ages, students will be excited to use their creativity in building models for science.

Using Legos to create models rather that consumable supplies, means that they can be assembled and disassembled over and over, for years to come.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","My students are mostly from the somewhat rural town of Riverton, Utah.

Often the students in my reading classes come to me as discouraged readers.  They are behind and many have decided to hate reading.  I want to help them access grade level material that they can be excited about.  In order to do that I need some supplies that will support their success.

Every year when my reading students leave my classroom I want them see how much they have improved.  I want their reading level to improve, but more importantly I want their confidence and excitement for reading to improve.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->I teach the struggling readers.  These readers struggle in a variety of ways from vocabulary to comprehension to motivation.  I need some items to support what we are already doing in the classroom.  The reading class focuses on students getting students to read at grade level while focusing on the common core standards for informational and literature reading.

Some of the items with provide audio support for my book group unit.  Often students struggle with speed and fluency.  Research has shown that offering audio support increases comprehension and motivation.

The other item is a class set of the non-fiction book: The Drowned City.  This book will be used with our class novel, Zane and the Hurricane.  This book will offer visualization and background information that will support the students' reading of the novel.  

These materials will help my students find success in an area that they struggle.  The materials will remain in the classroom and will help students for many years.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->",I feel one of my most important jobs as a reading teacher is to encourage students to be life-long readers.

Because their reading isn't on level, they have a difficult time accessing the material in all of their subjects.  I want to teach them to read better, but I also want to teach them to love reading.  The more they read, the better they will read.  Practice makes perfect!  My goal is to get the right books in each student's hands.  This can be challenging because my students have a variety of interests, which is why I need help expanding my classroom library. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->They will use the books for independent reading every day. This year I am trying an experiment to challenge my students to read 20 books over the course of the school year. In the past I have required little and they haven't turned into readers. I am hoping that with a tougher expectation and more access to reading material they will become readers. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->It will give students access to high interest reading material that they don't always have access to. I read a lot of teen literature, so I have chosen books that will appeal to a variety of readers. I hope to change the culture of my classroom to a room where books are not only read but also discussed. I want to create life-long readers. ","I love to read. I love the way reading expands my world. As a reading teacher I want to share that love with my students. I believe all students are readers, if I can find them the right book....","My students need high interest books like The Selection, Zach's Lie, and The Giver in order to get them hooked on reading.

This year, we plan on studying multiple perspectives by reading and compare/contrasting BOMB (Steve Sheinkin) with Sachiko: A Nagasaki Bomb Survivor's Story. Sachiko is the story of a little girl who survived the atomic bombs of WW2 and travels the world today speaking of her experiences before, during, and after the dropping of the atomic bomb. This will provide a valuable contribution to our current analysis of the book BOMB which describes the development of the atomic bomb.

This project will help create more empathetic and open-hearted communicators. My students are incREADibly bright and able to make connections very quickly. They need literature that will provide opportunities for them to do this while also providing opportunities to see the world through the eyes of those as intelligent and/or less fortunate as themselves.

In a competitive school/community environment of high expectations and little free time, it can be difficult to motivate students to slow down and savor learning.

I want my students to enjoy life and not just endure it. I want them to find passion and beauty in their education and their relationships at school. Learning should be joyous, and it should inspire hope and spontaneity and innovation. I'm on a mission to bring that color to the lives of students who sometimes can't see the forest for the trees.

<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Neil Gaiman’s brilliant lecture for the Reading Agency, delivered on Monday, October 14, 2013 at the Barbican in London, outlines many reasons why he believes libraries and reading will save the world. Among those, is the reason mentioned above: that fiction is a gateway drug to reading, and reading is a gateway to information, knowledge, and engagement with the world. Graphic novels like El Deafo and Maus help demotivated readers to break into that world.

Another, perhaps more important reason to read fiction is that it builds empathy. And empathy seems to be the balm that our world sorely lacks at the moment. Prejudice is broken down when we live inside other people's stories for a while. Books like Brown Girl Dreaming and Ender's Game helps us to imagine the realities of those who are different than us, whether that is in a past, present, future, or fantasy world. And it is my hope that my students will both enjoy the thrill of a story and be better people for the time that they spend getting to know the world through fiction.

Students in my reading class spend time reading every day. Many of them start the year saying they don't like to read. I want them to finish the year having fallen in love with books.

My reading students are in middle school and, if they are taking my class, they are not on grade level for reading.

Even though they may not read as well as their peers, they are often willing to take a leap and read a more challenging book if I can get them to see how interesting it is. It's essential that I have a compelling, age-appropriate, and up-to-date classroom library.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Many of my students say they don't like to read, but as James Patterson says, “There's no such thing as a kid who hates reading. There are kids who love reading, and kids who are reading the wrong books.” It's my job to help get the right book in to the hands of every student, so that every student will love to read. 

That's why I have requested a wide range of books, from the mystery novel ""The Face on the Milk Carton"" to the middle-school romance ""P.S. I Like You,"" and from the graphic novel ""Cardboard"" to the non-fiction book ""Warriors Don't Cry: A Searing Memoir of the Battle to Integrate Little Rock's Central High."" These books will help to spark my students' interest and make them lifelong readers. They will also help to keep my advanced readers reading. 

I really believe that reading is for everyone, and helps kids to be better and stronger in all academic pursuits and more empathetic, well-informed citizens.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->",I teach both gifted students and struggling readers.

I believe that every one of my students can be a reader and develop a love of reading - it just takes finding the right book.

My students are all middle school age, and even though their abilities vary greatly, they are each trying to navigate their way through the sometimes difficult and confusing teenage years. I believe reading is one way in which they can discover their place in the world and their connections to each other. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->I am particularly looking for high interest books that will capture the attention of my more reluctant readers. Their lack of confidence and experiences with reading tend to hold them back in many of their other classes. Students in these classes will be reading every day in my room. I am also challenging them to read 20 books this school year. They will write reviews about the books they read and share those reviews with each other. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->I am hoping that as we read and talk about books, each student will develop a love for books and grow in both skill and confidence so that they become better readers in all their classes and make reading a lifelong pursuit.

Getting them engaged on the day's task is always a challenge.  I begin each day with silent reading and we move on to a skill building activity: vocabulary, fluency, and reading strategies. I work hard so my students make significant gains. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My students are primarily active boys. I am constantly working to find activities and lessons that have a strong moral/ethical component while also engaging them in the content. I want my students to see the value in reading and also understand that every choice they make has a consequence.  I teach at a public school with strong community support, although the students in my classes usually have varying degrees of parental involvement. I feel that it is my responsibility to help them to see the bigger picture and make the connection between reading and their lives. The eighth grade reading class is the last opportunity many of them will have to work through reading stumbling blocks before being immersed in a high school curriculum with little support. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My students will be using the novel sets(A Long Walk to Water, Trash and Seedfolks) and Scope Magazine that I am requesting in a unit that is designed to get them motivated to get to work in their community.  This unit will be centered on the guiding question ""Can literature serve as a vehicle for social change?"" As we examine this question, students will work in literature circle groups, read non-fiction accounts of real life activist through the Scope magazine, and ultimately choose a cause for which to create a PSA announcement.  Students will then have an opportunity to pick a cause from those presented and do a service learning project. This unit is designed for students to learn that reading about the world has significant positive effects.  I want my students to be critical readers, curious about the injustices and positivity in the world, but then also activists who get involved and make a change for the better based on what they learn. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Donations will help immensely.  As a teacher, designing a curriculum can be frustrating as most supplies and resources are out dated and don't always reflect current events.  Subscriptions to classroom magazines are not available through regular textbook funds.  Special units such as the one I am proposing are difficult to fund over the space of one year.  Many times, all of the funding for new resources needs to be negotiated and carefully advocated for.  This process is a lengthy one. ",My reading classes are comprised struggling readers.

So not every student can read a book that will inspire them. 

Reading not only helps my students improve in all of their classes, but it also makes them better people. They get to see the world through another's eyes, live another's experiences, and feel another's heart. In the end, they learn empathy which will help them to live more meaningful, socially conscious lives. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","My students come from a very supportive community with involved parents.

They love engaging ""hands on"" investigations in science. But they also enjoy multimedia activities in which they can actively participate, either individually or in groups. he classroom is where the drive and knowledge for success is fostered in a lot of our students. It is the first place that many of them feel creative, intelligent, and capable of doing anything. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Brain Pop is a multimedia based technology which requires a subscription. It can be used in a group setting or individually. It is a program students enjoy since they are very engaged in learning.

Brain Pop is aligned with the state standards for science and other curricular areas. Through funding I was able to use BrainPop last year and found so many supportive lessons to help students understand science concepts. Brain Pop really helped students review and learn important concepts in a fun way. Students told me that they understood better after hearing/seeing it again or in a different way. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Self directed learning and the opportunity for enrichment are very important. Your generosity will give my students a chance to learn on their own, reinforce topics and most importantly, have fun while learning!

They work so hard to understand their work. They are kind to one another and help each other. They are full of energy and excitement for learning. They love finding out about new things. Sometimes that curiosity and energy is not a manageable behavior.
Providing PE equipment for a quick energy release time or for PE time really helps to get the wiggles out and get their brain ready to focus on content. Our PE and recess equipment are the same items. It seems that equipment walks away or disappears after the first few weeks of school. Having separate equipment will ensure that PE ""stuff"" will always be available for everyone.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Physical Education is only successful if you have the equipment to follow through on activities. My students need to begin the basics on catching, throwing, running, jumping, and understand the concept of working together and playing together.
Children need to learn to be physically fit and learn to work well with others and what better way then in a game.
Having this PE equipment will make planning activities for PE more consistent because I know that the equipment is going to be there to reinforce the necessary skills. Children are sitting too much in front of a screen. I want to get their bodies and minds engaged in physical play.

Students in my class face life with many challenges and struggles that many of us would take for granted. I have students that struggle to walk, struggle to express their wants and feelings, and I have students that require a bit more time to grasp basic concepts. BUT that does not deter them. They continue to persevere until they get it. 
<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My students need games and activities that focus on the word families, letter and number recognition, and math manipulatives to explore during center time. My students will use these materials to reinforce and build on their understanding of numbers for counting and simple math operations and also recognizing letters with the sound correlation, and then read words.  Small group instruction reaches my students better then large group instruction.  These activities will be used during centers throughout the day as we read, write, and do math.
These manipulatives and activities will help my students retain and maintain necessary basic foundations in math and reading.

<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Having a set of iPads will allow many uses and approaches to learning in the classroom. One way is to support our school focus of writing by siting evidence from the text to support student thinking. Students will use the iPads to gain access to articles, song lyrics, poems, etc. Students will exam lyrics from a song, discuss the meaning behind the song with peers, take notes on the iPad for later writing information, and then create an opinion piece based on evidence from the text and the notes on the discussion. 
Students will use the iPads to support STEM projects.  The iPads will be used to code and program robots. Groups of students will code information to direct a flying robotic device on a path. The iPad will be used as the controller. The codes are fed into the iPad and students are able to demonstrate the success of their programming through a visual demonstration. 
Students will be able to use the iPads to research information about STEM projects such as building bridges. After researching, students will create plans to engineer their bridge. The iPad will be used to record data for the project and then after testing the hypothesis, record the results. Using this information will give them an opportunity to create a model based on the research and digital plan. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","My students learn best when they are fully engaged and what better way than the use of technology.

For our students to develop into engaged and informed citizens, they will need to practice the skills required of learners in the digital age. Most of their information comes from digital sources, but that does not ensure all of their sources are sound. They must develop the skills to distinguish between reliable information and faulty claims. Learning today is not a passive process!  Math will be enriched using technology.

Students in my class face life with many challenges and struggles that many of us would take for granted.
I have students that struggle to walk, struggle to express their wants and feelings, and I have students that require a bit more time to grasp basic concepts. BUT that does not deter them. They continue to persevere until they get it. 
<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My students need games and sensory activities that focus on the letter and number recognition, math manipulatives to explore numeration and sensory materials. My students will use these materials to reinforce and build on their understanding of numbers for counting and simple math operations and also recognizing letters with the sound correlation, and then read words. Small group instruction reaches my students better then large group instruction. These activities will be used during centers throughout the day as we read, write, and do math.
These manipulatives and activities will help my students retain and maintain necessary basic foundations in math and reading.
My students struggle to maintain the information they have learned during the day. Multiple and varied experiences help to retain understanding of essential information.

The school I work at has a student population of 40% poverty level. I am new to the district and would like to WOW my students with fun activities for them to do. Instead of them learning about science, students are practicing science. 
The student population is diverse with a variety of learning abilities, some of these students only access technology at school, so I would like their experience to be a positive one. Teaching students is my joy, when I can take students who hate science, and turn them around by the end of the school year to love science then I have done my job. 
It is my belief that every child has the ability to learn if you have the right bait. Through Donors Choose, I hope to get the materials I need to make the light bulb go on for all of my students. If we capture the attention of the students of today, then tomorrow they will enter the world as leaders hopefully with a knowledge without prejudice, to make the world a better and safer place to live.
<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->The biology slides will enable students to see cellular structures. The kits offer a variety of slides from onion slices to blood samples so students can view cellular structures through a microscope. The Astronomy kits will help students with hands on activities to create concrete connections and promote critical thinking, One kit contains information about the Universe as a whole with several pictures and activities. The Molecule sets will enable student to actually create molecules so they can see how chemical bonds are made. This will help students gain and understanding about chemical bonds and how molecules are shaped and made.

These supplies will improve student learning and critical thinking skills by allowing students to participate in hands on activities to enhance their learning.The best way for students to learn is when they can visually see and construct with hands on activities the curriculum they are learning.

A magazine subscription also comes with a variety of useful tools including videos, worksheets, and an online version students can access at home. To view a sample of this magazine, go to http://classroommagazines.scholastic.com/issues/2016-01-24/book#/4

Many of my students struggle with reading which makes it difficult to explore science topics. Students of all reading abilities at my previous school loved to look through the magazines and were willing to read the articles to learn more because they were interesting and relevant.  Hesitant readers were able to watch the videos and interact with the class before and after reading articles to help them gain motivation as well as better understand what they read and the curriculum. 

By donating to this project, you will be providing my students with a class set of magazines which will be a valuable tool to help them improve their reading skills and, as a result, their education.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","My favorite parts of teaching are the ""Ah ha!"" moments where a child's face lights up as he/she finally understands a difficult concept or accomplishes something they once considered impossible....",My students need Science World magazines to help bring science to life.,Math & Science,"Environmental Science, Health & Life Science",Grades 9-12,Books,533.24,2017-07-31,2017-11-30,Fully Funded,2017-08-03,Joel P Jensen Middle School,suburban,58.0,Utah,84088,West Jordan,Salt Lake,Jordan School District,Ms.,2016-08-17

The headphones will serve a great purpose in the watch it stations where students will engage in a short video to explain the topic we are studying.  Right now we are watching these videos as a class and I feel they are losing the independence this station could provide.

They can then examine within themselves if they exhibit those qualities as well as those they associate with.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","My students are amazing!

Students need supplies to help with their fitness videos. They are often found lifting chairs and standing on one leg to demonstrate the elements of fitness. Which is great and resourceful but I think they need some real gym equipment to fully explore how to work out that part of their body. That is why I have requested weights, balance balls, resistance bands, body fat indicator, and a Sit and reach.

They touch and spread germs wherever they go.

I want to give my students a visual about the germs that they come in contact with every day. What is on their cell phone? What germs are lurking on that locker? And did you know there can be up to 10,000 germs on your desk at any given moment?

I'm requesting agar powder, sticky notes, cotton swabs, and petri dishes for experiments on germs and their environment.   Having the petri dishes and agar will bring the students to a realization of what is around them and hopefully help them realize they need to wash their hands more often.

Many of my students come from broken homes and have taken on some great responsibilities.  

They take care of siblings, homes, and schoolwork all on their own. For some, it breaks them down. For others, it brings them to their full potential.
I have seen some students give when they have little. I have also seen many struggle through issues that many would shriek under. But through it all, they show up and do what they can to succeed.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My students need an activity that helps them in multiple ways. I need my students to gain critical decision making skills. I want my students to understand that it takes time and planning and work to come to an educated decision. Along with that, they need to learn to work together and gain insight into others ideas and contributions.

This breakout kit will facilitate critical thinking, teamwork, and decision making. 

All of which I want my students to learn. This kit is versatile an can be used for many other topics as well.

I am excited to see my students working together and gaining much needed lifelong skills.","My students are amazing! Teaching at a low-income school has given me such great insight into the lives of some incredible individuals.

They challenge me everyday to re-examine what I think I know about teenagers and how much they can accomplish. But still, many of my students, for many reasons, currently achieve below grade level.

I want to give my students every opportunity to succeed. I want to provide them with the tools they need to make big things happen in their lives--for so many of them, those tools have always been out of reach.

In my Language Arts classroom, my students learn about much more than grammar or poetry. They learn skills that will help them navigate the world--and I hope that, when they leave my classroom, they see that the world is wide open to them.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Many of my students don't have exposure to good books outside of school, which means they only associate reading with work. I am making a ""reader's corner"" in my classroom where students can take up a good book and see that reading can actually be fun--it's not just another excuse for teachers to give out assignments. I can imagine that the beanbag chair I'm asking for will become a popular place to relax and read!

I am compiling high-interest, quality books so that my students can find something good to read and then take that book home to read in their spare time. We need a variety of good books in many genres, as well as a bean bag for a comfy place to read! Our titles include Brown Girl Dreaming, Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library, Looking for Alaska, Feed, The Chocolate War, The One and Only Ivan, and many more. Many of the titles I have gathered here, like the Maze Runner series and To Kill a Mockingbird, make the lists of best young adult books. I have also asked for several different nonfiction titles, which will expose my students to various different topics, from the Civil Rights movement to life behind the Iron Curtain.

My hope is that every student, no matter their interests, will become a reader and recognize that reading is worthwhile. Not only will this skill help them in my Language Arts class, it will also serve them throughout their lives.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","My students are talented, diverse, goofy, hard-working, and eager to learn.

Yet, students in American public school students have access to an average of 1 computer for every 3.8 students. In Utah, that number skyrockets to 1 computer for every 5.4 students. 

Students in low income areas are missing out on learning key skills to become successful citizens. Technology fluency is crucial to their success. But, in order to practice these skills in English, Science, Social Studies, Math, or any other class, students must have consistent access. 

Only 73% of students have access to the internet at home. Many use their phones, but typing an essay on a phone versus a computer is incredibly difficult. Help us better support our learners by placing computers in our classroom so students can have access to research, reading, writing, and multimedia materials on a daily basis. 

Each year, as we increase our technology, we move closer to  our paperless dream! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Research shows that students need increased access to technology in academia. Being in a low economic area has decreased my students inherent access. 

On a daily basis, 2-3 computers will be used each class period to support IEP and 504 accommodations where speech recognition software will be used for note taking and longer writing assignments.

Additional computers will be used on an as-needed basis for students for working on group projects and presentations, writing assignments, publishing work in contests, researching, checking grades, etc. 

Having daily access to these materials allows instruction to include technology skills, and pushes us towards using GoogleDocs, GoogleSlides, and other apps that help students practice using more technology and less paper products!

 <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Having direct access on a daily basis can make the difference between publication, academic recognition, a complete essay, and practicing basic skills like sending an email and attaching a document. 

Our ""tech savvy"" youth is durable and ready to learn, but they can't run if they don't know how to walk, can't code if they can't turn on the computer, can't submit a resume if they don't know how to send an email, and they need your help to refine these skills!

Students in low income areas are missing out on learning key skills to become successful citizens. Technology fluency is crucial to their success. But, in order to practice these skills in English, Science, Social Studies, Math, or any other class, students must have consistent access. 

Only 73% of students have access to the internet at home. Many use their phones, but typing an essay on a phone versus a computer is incredibly difficult. Help us better support our learners by placing computers in our classroom so students can have access to research, reading, writing, and multimedia materials on a daily basis. 

Each year, as we increase our technology, we move closer to  our paperless dream! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Research shows that students need increased access to technology in academia. Being in a low economic area has decreased my students inherent access. 

On a daily basis, 2-3 computers will be used each class period to support IEP and 504 accommodations where speech recognition software will be used for note taking and longer writing assignments.

Additional computers will be used on an as-needed basis for students for working on group projects and presentations, writing assignments, publishing work in contests, researching, checking grades, etc. 

Having daily access to these materials allows instruction to include technology skills, and pushes us towards using GoogleDocs, GoogleSlides, and other apps that help students practice using more technology and less paper products!

 <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Having direct access on a daily basis can make the difference between publication, academic recognition, a complete essay, and practicing basic skills like sending an email and attaching a document. 

Our ""tech savvy"" youth is durable and ready to learn, but they can't run if they don't know how to walk, can't code if they can't turn on the computer, can't submit a resume if they don't know how to send an email, and they need your help to refine these skills!

It makes sense for the opera or for meditating, but in most classrooms and child care centers, it's given far more honor than it deserves. Children need to move."" My students need to move too! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Have you ever watched a squirrel? They twitch, dart, and leap. Nothing about their movement shows a calm or relaxing demeanor. They epitomize quick, rapid movement, just like my seventh grade ""squirrelly"" students. In my Language Arts class, my students must train their minds and skills to focus on reading, writing, speaking, and listening. This is especially difficult because many of my ""squirrels"" suffer from learning disabilities which make focusing on one task even more difficult. Additionally, my students are in their first year in middle school which means they will be sitting in their desks for longer than they are used to. Using pedal bikes is one of the many ways I am working to incorporate focus and healthy living into my classroom.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->There are certain individual activities where students need to sit and listen while there are others where they need to sit and write. In my class we also use SSR (Sustained Silent Reading) to practice reading quietly. I plan for students to use these pedal bikes during research, essay writing, lectures, and reading. I also hope to also use these during group work. My goal is to promote physical fitness and offer an outlet for my student's energy.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Like squirrels, my students embody movement. They twist in their chairs, fidget, and squiggle at every chance they get. Providing pedal bikes will give my students a physical output that promotes focus. This will help them concentrate on individual tasks and will encourage stronger learning habits. Not only that, but my students will also feel the benefit of increased circulation and have the opportunity to avoid sedentary sitting while channeling their movements towards a healthy lifestyle!

As the teacher librarian at a middle school, I considered all the kids at the school as MY students.  Every morning, before school , I see about 120 of my students come to the library to use the computers, play games, read, do homework, checkout books, and socialize because they want to.  There is a lot of diversity among my students and the school located in a low socioeconomic area of the district.  Many of the students don't have access to books and computers at home are really appreciative of these resources.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->     Last year, I had a vision of creating a space within the library to give students an opportunity to use their creativity to tinker, build, design, invent and PLAY! Many of the students at my school do not have the resources to engage their imagination with hands-on activities.  So, I converted a storage room within the library into a Makerspace Room!  

     My goal is to fill this room with lots of opportunities for students to have unstructured learning and play.  The students will use clay and paints to explore their artistic talents by creating clay designs.  STEM is also a big focus at our school,  the students can experiment and have hands-on experience in testing the principles of gravity and motion with the Marble Run or the Marble Maze Logic game.  Students will also learn about the principles of electrical circuitry and alternative energy with the Snap Circuit set.  I also have a wall of dry erase poster boards, so I wanted to have dry  erase pens for students to draw, write messages, or create a poem.   I will pair all of these activities with books to spark their imaginations.  

This space, along with the materials will be accessible to all 
students during our ""free choice activity"".  The teacher’s can also schedule the use of this room during class time and it can be used for the after school STEM program.  
                                                                     
I am really excited to see this place blossom into cool place for my students to discover the scientist, the artist, the engineer, and the mathematician within them.

My favorite way to teach math to my first graders is to launch a math lesson with something that grabs their attention. Math literature grabs the students attention, then we can explore what the story was about with manipulatives. After exploring the math concept, we can then discuss what we learned.
Learning math through launch, explore, and discuss, is so much more effective than completing a worksheet. I want to engage my first graders in math and learning.

The student was assigned to document our life in class.  At the end of each week, I would download the pictures and put them in a slide show to watch on the last day of school.  It was always the best part of the last day.  Remembering all the things that we had done, remembering when students came or left our classroom, memories that evoked emotion.
It was great to see the students learn how to take fun pictures and develop a new skill that they might never otherwise learn.
All of this came to an end when the classroom camera died.  I don't have one to replace it.  Please help us replace it!<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","It's always fun to see student learn new skills. Their eyes light up. You can see the happiness in their eyes.

Think about those kids for a minute.  Put yourself in the place of a 16 year old junior in high school living in a car.  Where do you shower?  Where do you wash your clothes?  Where do you get your meals after school, on the weekends, or during spring break?  

A student cannot focus on my accounting lesson if they are worried about feeding their little sister or staying warm in the middle of a cold Utah winter.  These students are very real.  I see their faces, hear their stories, and dry their tears.  This project is for our homeless kids.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->I started teaching two years ago after a long career as a litigation attorney. One afternoon I watched two defeated students walk into the office an hour after school ended. The office doors were locked, but a counselor was waiting to warmly greet the kids and usher them back to her office. I watched our principal and staff spring into action, embracing these kids as if they were their own. I later learned the two sisters had returned home after school to find a note from their mom saying she left and wouldn't be coming back. She told her kids to call the school for help and wished them a happy life. This was a Friday afternoon. The oldest child was 15 years old.

Each year, my students and I host a ""Please Feed the Grizzlies"" campaign. We ask our student body to donate non-perishable food and toiletries to our school pantry. The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. The student is welcomed into the pantry and allowed to fill a backpack full of whatever food they need. If they aren't comfortable with this, one of our staff members will anonymously drop off a box of food.

Unfortunately, the pantry doesn't satisfy all of the students' needs. We expanded the pantry this year to include gently worn jeans and t-shirts. What we lack, however, is shoes. We need both athletic and non-athletic shoes for these students. While I personally believe that anything is possible with a great pair of shoes, our kids simply need a pair with some tread, without any holes, or frankly without the memories they walked away from.","Over 110 students in my high school are homeless, living in cars, behind businesses, or in shelters.

The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. Food, however, is just one of the primary needs these kids lack. These kids need warmth.

We have over 2,100 kids who are homeless in our school district.
Our homeless liaison receives countless requests for coats for these students throughout the year.  Homelessness is an epidemic and, in our schools, it has a real face, the face of my students.

John didn't look like a homeless kid.  He came to class every day wearing the standard ""uniform,"" jeans and a t-shirt.  He'd struggled in a prior finance class and was taking my course for recovery credit.  We developed a bond from the beginning as he had a wicked, intelligent sense of humor I simply adored.  He didn't use it often, but once he felt safe that kid was a crack up.  John came to class, did the work, and scored well on the exams... until one day he just withdrew, becoming a shell of the kid I knew.  I bugged him daily, trying every method I could to draw him out... teasing, confronting, joking, but nothing worked.  Finally, after 4 days of my nonstop cajoling, he told me.  

John was living in his car.  It was a Friday and he was scared.  John qualified for free school lunch, so for the past four days he'd had a full lunch and breakfast, but he was now facing a long weekend without any access to food.  This project is for the many ""Johns"" in our school district.

<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->I started teaching two years ago after a long career as a litigation attorney.  As I started my new gig, I was surprised to learn my school had over 110 homeless students.  Each year, my students and I host a ""Please Feed the Grizzlies"" campaign, asking our student body to donate non-perishable food and toiletries to our school pantry. The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. Food, however, is just one of the primary needs these kids lack.  These kids need warmth.

We have over 2,100 kids who are homeless in our school district.  Our homeless liaison estimates that she receives requests for, on average, 10 coats from each of the 54 schools in our district, that's over 540 coats per year.  That's an incredible number of cold children.  Homelessness is an epidemic and, in our schools, it has a real face, the face of my students.

John didn't look like a homeless kid.  He came to class every day wearing the standard ""uniform,"" jeans and a t-shirt.  He'd struggled in a prior finance class and was taking my course for recovery credit.  We developed a bond from the beginning as he had a wicked, intelligent sense of humor I simply adored.  He didn't use it often, but once he felt safe that kid was a crack up.  John came to class, did the work, and scored well on the exams... until one day he just withdrew, becoming a shell of the kid I knew.  I bugged him daily, trying every method I could to draw him out... teasing, confronting, joking, but nothing worked.  Finally, after 4 days of my nonstop cajoling, he told me.  

John was living in his car.  It was a Friday and he was scared.  John qualified for free school lunch, so for the past four days he'd had a full lunch and breakfast, but he was now facing a long weekend without any access to food.  This project is for the many ""Johns"" in our school district.

<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->I started teaching two years ago after a long career as a litigation attorney.  As I started my new gig, I was surprised to learn my school had over 110 homeless students.  Each year, my students and I host a ""Please Feed the Grizzlies"" campaign, asking our student body to donate non-perishable food and toiletries to our school pantry. The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. Food, however, is just one of the primary needs these kids lack.  These kids need warmth.

We have over 2,100 kids who are homeless in our school district.  Our homeless liaison estimates that she receives requests for, on average, 10 coats from each of the 54 schools in our district, that's over 540 coats per year.  That's an incredible number of cold children.  Homelessness is an epidemic and, in our schools, it has a real face, the face of my students.

As I started my new gig, I was surprised to learn my school had over 110 homeless students.  Each year, my students and I host a ""Please Feed the Grizzlies"" campaign, asking our student body to donate non-perishable food and toiletries to our school pantry. The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. Food, however, is just one of the primary needs these kids lack.  These kids need warmth.

We have over 2,100 kids who are homeless in our school district.  Our homeless liaison estimates that she receives requests for, on average, 10 coats from each of the 54 schools in our district, that's over 540 coats per year.  That's an incredible number of cold children.  Homelessness is an epidemic and, in our schools, it has a real face, the face of my students. 

I'd like to provide coats for these kids.  While I know this is a huge project, I've been able to secure some help.

He didn't use it often, but once he felt safe that kid was a crack up.  John came to class, did the work, and scored well on the exams... until one day he just withdrew, becoming a shell of the kid I knew.  I bugged him daily, trying every method I could to draw him out... teasing, confronting, joking, but nothing worked.  Finally, after 4 days of my nonstop cajoling, he told me.  

John was living in his car.  It was a Friday and he was scared.  John qualified for free school lunch, so for the past four days he'd had a full lunch and breakfast, but he was now facing a long weekend without any access to food.  This project is for the many ""Johns"" in our school district.

A student cannot focus on my accounting lesson if they are worried about feeding their little sister or staying warm in the middle of a cold Utah winter.  These students are very real.

One afternoon I watched two defeated students walk into the office an hour after school ended. The office doors were locked, but a counselor was waiting to warmly greet the kids and usher them back to her office. I watched our principal and staff spring into action, embracing these kids as if they were their own. I later learned the two sisters had returned home after school to find a note from their mom saying she left and wouldn't be coming back. She told her kids to call the school for help and wished them a happy life. This was a Friday afternoon. The oldest child was 15 years old.

Grizzlies take care of our family.
Each year, my students and I host a ""Please Feed the Grizzlies"" campaign. We ask our student body to donate non-perishable food and toiletries to our school pantry. The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. The student is welcomed into the pantry and allowed to fill a backpack full of whatever food they need. If they aren't comfortable with this, one of our staff members will anonymously drop off a box of food.

We still have some serious needs that have not been met.  First off, we need backpacks.  Students need something ""normal"" to carry food back home.  We absolutely DO NOT want our kids to be labeled or singled out for taking advantage of our pantry. Secondly, students need winter coats.  My school is located in Utah where winters are cold.  A warm coat is an expensive purchase and typically far outside the reach of these families.  ","Over 110 students in my high school are homeless, living in cars, behind businesses, or in shelters.

The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. Food, however, is just one of the primary needs these kids lack. These kids need warmth.

We have over 2,100 kids who are homeless in our school district.
Our homeless liaison receives countless requests for coats for these students throughout the year. Homelessness is an epidemic and, in our schools, it has a real face, the face of my students.

Each year, my students and I host a ""Please Feed the Grizzlies"" campaign, asking our student body to donate non-perishable food and toiletries to our school pantry. The pantry is open to ANY student who needs help no questions asked. Food, however, is just one of the primary needs these kids lack. These kids need warmth.

We have over 2,100 kids who are homeless in our school district.
Our homeless liaison receives countless requests for coats for these students throughout the year. Homelessness is an epidemic and, in our schools, it has a real face, the face of my students.

I'd like to provide coats for these kids. It's been incredible watching donations come in from around the world.  We love to read and share your comments with my students.

His dad left the family suddenly, leaving his unemployed mom to care for a family of 4 kids.  They lost their housing and found themselves suddenly homeless.  Our student lived behind a strip mall for almost a year, camping overnight in a sleeping bag and a tent.  Unfortunately, this is not an aberration here.  Salt Lake City has a large homeless population and inadequate housing support.  Accordingly, we have many tent cities housing families with children.  It's heartbreaking to watch our families huddle under blankets and sleeping bags in the bitter winter cold.  Knowing this is happening in your city is difficult, knowing it's happening to your students is impossible. 

A student cannot focus on my accounting lesson if they are worried about feeding their little sister or staying warm in the middle of a cold Utah winter.  These students are very real.

I've see families do whatever they have to do to survive.  I teach business classes, specifically accounting, business law, personal finance.  Imagine being a student in my finance class listening to my lecture on investing your 401(k) knowing all the while that you are going ""home"" to a tent.  
Every year Utah residents are asked to donate tents and sleeping bags to our homeless ""cities.""  This became so much more real when we discovered that several of our students were residents of these pop-up cities.  They were literally freezing to death outside.

From the outset, I tell my students that the most math they will need is basic addition, subtraction, and, if we get really crazy, we might multiply.  This typically assuages their fear and allows us to get down to business.
Unfortunately, we don't have the tools to make this process easy.  We don't have calculators or numeric pads, so students share scientific calculators or use a Google calculator.  It's a disaster and replete with errors.  Inevitably, students get frustrated with the errors arising from common data entry mistakes and many kids just give up.

Not.so.much.  Accounting is now offered as a math credit and, for most of my students, it's their last hope of passing math.  Most of the kids have struggled with and largely failed math for years. They are the kids every math teacher has given up on and, somehow, they find their way into an accounting class.  

This class is typically their first exposure to a professional atmosphere.  My school is located in a ethnically and socioeconomically diverse area.  The students come from all walks of life.  Many are farmers, many live in homes with multiple families.  These kids have never even considered a business class, let alone a career in business.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Accounting may not seem like a sexy subject, but for these kids it's their first exposure to a professional career that is well within their reach.  From the outset, I tell my students that the most math they will need is basic addition, subtraction, and, if we get really crazy, we might multiply.  This typically assuages their fear and allows us to get down to business.
Unfortunately, we don't have the tools to make this process easy.  We don't have calculators or numeric pads, so students share scientific calculators or use a Google calculator.  It's a disaster and replete with errors.  Inevitably, students get frustrated with the errors arising from common data entry mistakes and many kids just give up. My students need numeric keypads for success in class. 

The numeric pads will combat this frustration by giving the students a technological resource to enter the numbers in correctly.  Instead of fighting the data entry, we can focus on learning and practicing the subject.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","On my first day of teaching accounting, I expected a class full of business geeks.

My students need leveled readers in Spanish, such as ""Patricia va a California"" and ""Casi se muere,"" that includes age appropriate topics which also include an elements of culture. 

My Students
The students really understand all this language that is happening when taught through Story Telling. They are having fun too! Welcome to my CI/TPRS classroom where comprehension is key and acquisition is the goal, but the individual students are the most important.

Most of my students have little to no understanding of Spanish to start the year, they have been taught through traditional methods that do not encourage language proficiency.
In my class  they become more and more proficient in Spanish and more culturally sensitive and caring to people of other cultures and backgrounds.

My Project
The Spanish language novels ""Patricia va a California"" and ""Casi se muere"" are language level appropriate for Spanish 2 and Spanish 3 students. At the same time the topics are age appropriate and engaging for high school students. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Many students learn better in language classes when there are exciting stories and culture influences in the classroom. Every student learns differently and when there are exciting stories and topics to discuss in class they are more engaged and participate better. For instance, students read books more thoroughly when they can relate to the topic or they have an interest in it. 
The novels that I have chosen are books that the students can relate to and also shows the difference between the American and Guatemalan culture. This will allow my students to understand the Spanish language and improve their school lives through reading. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->","Learning Spanish through Story Telling

Now that we are much more comfortable with presenting, we are challenging ourselves yet again. We are starting to present to peer groups and younger groups. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My students are excellent when they are challenged. We have began practicing for presentation competitions. FBLA is one competition venue that we focus on more, however, many of my students may be forming their first ever DECA team. This is very gratifying for an educator when the lessons you have taught them are now motivating them to use them at a very high level. This is even more impressive when you see that the local culture may not place a huge emphasis on ""outside-the-box"" careers. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->These students will be teaching and explaining simple lessons about finance and communication to their peers, elementary students, and even a forum of district shareholders. 10 of my students joined me and another educator up on the State's Capitol. a total of 6 testified in front of the Appropriations Sub Committee in support of Computer Technology and Productivity Programs. This was pretty impressive as these students will be ones out of millions that ever get that opportunity. They met after their presentation with the members of that Committee and received great praises and additional encouragement. That may not seem neat as you read this but it was impressive to say the least. The students will use the stand as a presentation platform and the amp to connect to the speakers previously purchased for my classroom. The portable white board and magnets will be used for the projectors screen and an additional presentation tools to chart or write down key points.
 <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->This project will make a difference because I care. I should end it there but I won't. My students are forced to make changes and adapt to circumstances. Having to prepare and present at random and hit their goals, reach their points, engage listeners, connect with the audience on their understanding level causes them to become aware of their awesomeness. We have been given many things this year and each thing has added in some way to prepare them for this future they are creating.

 <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My students are amazing. We are a one cluster (only one high school in our district) district and my students are the designers for the PowerPoint presentations for the district. Few of them have the computer software at home where they could access emailed documents and work on them at home. Being that we operate our system off of local accounts, they are unable to save and assure that their work is unedited after saving. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Some of these kids have very little ability or resources to purchase one of these storage devices. We do get by without having these but time and time again students think they remember where they have saved it two days before as they open and begin working on someone else's work. It causes frustration and agony for them as they then worry how they will show their work and hand in assignments that they create.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->A thumb drive is one feature that will allow the students to save their wonderful work. This allows them to send items into the district office as they present work using this device. They will be able to accomplish the tasks at hand with confidence. It is very comforting knowing that you have your file and it is the exact way you saved it when presenting to businesses and promoting oneself to those businesses without unexpected hiccups. This is one way of adding confidence to their personalities. ",Thumbs Up!

They stayed on schedule and had very few/minor errors.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->The students present business and entrepreneur ideas in class and or in events around the state. We film many of these presentations and then we analyze them over and over again. Our criteria for analyzing these clips can range from presentation skills and language to ideas, marketing plans, future, and financial forecasting.  These students will use these speakers to actually listen to the presentation rather than trying to lip read as they think they hear the presentation.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->My project will make a difference in the lives of these students. Funding of this project will give these students an easier time listening to presentations. They will be able to analyze other elements that we previously haven't been able to -- items such as background noise, judges' questions, audience response/feedback and others.   ",So I have these two tiny speakers. They are unable to send sound to all of the class members when we are watching student projects.

At Alcatraz, we will learn about famous inmate Al Capone, a crime boss who gained notoriety during the Prohibition era, and did you know that Alcatraz was once occupied by a Native American activist group in the late 1960s? Visiting the Golden Gate Bridge will give my students the opportunity to review FDR’s New Deal legislation and the effect it had on recovery during the Great Depression, and a tour of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood will give them a better sense of the hippie counterculture that originated there in the 1960s.

There is nothing that drives a passion for history quite like traveling!   As a part of this trip, we will tour Angel Island to explore stories of the over 175,000 Chinese immigrants who were processed through the Pacific immigration station.

Visiting the Golden Gate Bridge will give my students the opportunity to review FDR’s New Deal legislation and the effect it had on recovery during the Great Depression, and a tour of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood will give them a better sense of the hippie counterculture that originated there in the 1960s.

BUT - not all students can afford an opportunity like this.  As their instructor, it is my goal to try to offer three scholarships to students who would not otherwise be able to join us for this incredible experience!

There is nothing that drives a passion for history quite like traveling!   As a part of this trip, we will tour Angel Island to explore stories of the over 175,000 Chinese immigrants who were processed through the Pacific immigration station.  At Alcatraz, we will learn about famous inmate Al Capone, a crime boss who gained notoriety during the Prohibition era, and did you know that Alcatraz was once occupied by a Native American activist group in the late 1960s? Visiting the Golden Gate Bridge will give my students the opportunity to review FDR’s New Deal legislation and the effect it had on recovery during the Great Depression, and a tour of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood will give them a better sense of the hippie counterculture that originated there in the 1960s.
